## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm a senior at Indiana State University with a passion for programming and problem-solving. When I'm not working on assignments or small projects, you might find me under the hood of my car, a 1995 Camaro. I enjoy hands-on work and figuring out how things operate, both in code and on the road.
