Observations about MCSS
===========================

Please write down a few sentences recording your observations about the
runtime behavior of each algorithm as the size of the input array
increases. You should reflect on our theoretical asymptotic analysis of
each algorithm and how that shows up in each of the plots.

When Running the racing.py program the brute force alogorithm is increadibly slow. 
Taking roughly 12 seconds to execute with an N value of 850. This algorithm would not
be ideal in any situation. This is easily approved upon by the better brute force
algorithm that runs increadibly faster than the naive approach. 

The linear approach if however obviously surperior taking exponentially less time to run.
