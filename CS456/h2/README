ASSIGNMENT h2
Due Date: Feb 2 at 11:59PM EST
Points: 10

You will be writing a program that returns information about a file.

To do this assignment sucessfully, you need to read the following:
- man 2 stat
- man 7 inode

These will have valuable information on how to do some of these things, like
- the stat structure 
- what each of these entries in that structure means
- Macros (in the inode page)


I also would like you to write the program so that it'll compile without 
warnings (i.e. issues that could lead to undesirable behavior in a program). To 
check to see if your program could result in warnings, compile with the -Wall 
option enabled.

So for this program, it would look like this

> gcc -Wall -o info info.c

That way, it will show you warnings as well as errors.


To set it up so that you won't have to type -Wall every single time, using your 
favorite text editor (vim, nano, or whatever), on your home directory there is a
hidden file called .cshrc (assuming you're using tcsh, which most of you are, 
shells like zsh use .zshrc) open that, and add the following line

alias gcc       'gcc -g -Wall'

Save and exit, then in the home directory, type source .cshrc (if using tcsh) 
for the settings to take effect immediately. otherwise, these will take effect 
when you next log in.

To find which shell you are using, run "echo $shell"

the '-Wall' option  will show all warnings, and the '-g' option will enable 
debugging so we can use programs like gdb to help diagnose issues with your code.

A working version is available in the "test" directory. You will get no points if 
the program doesn't compile.
