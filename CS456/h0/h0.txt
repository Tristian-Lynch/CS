Then edit this file by adding the following

* Name: Tristian Lynch
* Class Standing: Senior

* I first started programming in high-school when I took Computer Science and AP Computer Science my Junior and Senior years of highschool.
  Since then I have completed 3 years so far at ISU and graduate this coming fall. I am proficient with C/C++, Java, and Python. Having
  used Python primarily while I've been in school, Java while I was in highschool, and for personal projects I primarily use C++.

* I am familiar as being accustom to C++ which is C with a much wider feature set.

* I have yet to have a course where we primarily use C as the language for the class so I am excited for that. 

When you are finished editing this file, please submit this assignment to the CS server using handin.
