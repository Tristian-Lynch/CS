ASSIGNMENT h1
Due Date: February 3 @ 11:59PM EST
Points: 10

In this assignment, you will be implementing (a somewhat stripped down version 
of) two UNIX commands, head and cp  using Standard C Library functions. This is 
basically a warm up exercise to get students familiar with programming in C, as 
this will be the main language in this class.

myHead.c - This program will print the first 10 lines of a file if no argument is 
specified, or if the user does specify a number, it will print that number of 
lines. 

copy.c - This will take a file and create a copy of that file. 

The programs have already been started for you, your job is to finish them so 
that they compile and work correctly. There is an implementation of the cat 
command in the in-class code (under the Jan23 directory) that you can take a 
look at to help you with this assignment.

There are working versions of these programs in the "test" directory. Also note 
that while there is a manifest file present, you do not need to modify it. 
If your program does not compile you will not recieve any points for that 
program, so make sure it works!
